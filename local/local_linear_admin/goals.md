# What we want from linear

- [ ] documentation: write down anything you find out about linear schema specifically, how we are already using it.

- [*] **Linear** function to create issue attached to CO2 target project, in the backlog, with a tag that we get from the frontend i.e. the current route the user is on when they provide the feedback, the feedback itself, and another tag that we get from the frontend i.e. the user's email address + a generic tag 'feedback' to identify the issue as a feedback issue.

- [ ] **Linear** function that returns the list of issues attached to the CO2 target project, in the 'current cycle' (taking in cycle id)
  - [ ] **Linear** function that returns the id of a cycle from a date.

- [ ] get all issues from linear that are tagged with 'feedback' and 'co2-target-asset-management-melos' and 'current cycle' (taking in cycle id) - essentially compound queries based on AND multiple tags.

- [ ] **Linear** all issues for a project, broken down by priority, and then by status.
